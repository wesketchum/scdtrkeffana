# scdtrkeffana

Repository for work on measuring tracking efficiency in uboone LArTPC using cosmic ray data.

To use this repository, you should do the following:

Make a new installation of larsoft, uboone flavor:
--- <source your various setup scripts>
--- setup uboonecode v04_33_00 -qe9:prof (may be different version in future ... check ups/product_deps)
--- mkdir my_dev_area; cd my_dev_area; mrb newDev
--- source localProducts_uboonecode_v04_33_00_e9_prof/setup

Now get the repository using mrb
--- cd srcs
--- mrb g https://github.com/wesketchum/scdtrkeffana.git

Then do the normal routines for building (you can do 'python scdtrkeffana/tools/useful_info.py')

You will probably want access to the repository: easiest with a github account (let me know yours).
OR
I can pull from your local repository so long as I have permissions to see it and you let me know when you want me to pull
(max I'm willing to do: once a week.)
